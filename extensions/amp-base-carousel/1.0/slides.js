/**
 * How the slides are ordered when looping:
 *
 * We want to make sure that the user can scroll all the way to the opposite
 * end (either forwards or backwards) of the carousel, but no further (no
 * looping back past where you started). We render elements dynamically
 * for a desirable scrolling order to allow the browser to scroll as well as
 * providing targets for the browser to snap on. This is important as these
 * targets need to be present before the scroll starts for things to work
 * correctly.
 *
 * The elements are ordered depending on the reference point, called
 * the restingIndex to allow full movement forwards and backwards. You can
 * imagine the DOM structure looks like the following if you have 5 slides:
 *
 * [1][2][3][4][5]
 *
 * When the restingIndex is the first index, we should translate slides as follows:
 *
 * [4][5][1][2][3]
 *
 * This ensures that if you move left or right, there is a slide to show.
 *
 * When the user stops scrolling, we update the restingIndex and show/hide the
 * appropriate spacers. For example, if the user started at slide '1' and moved
 * left to slide '4', the UI would eventually stop because there is
 * nothing more to the left of slide '4'.
 *
 * [4][5][1][2][3]
 *
 * Once scrolling stops, however, the reference point would be reset and this would
 * update to the following with the next render:
 *
 * [2][3][4][5][1]
 *
 * Ordering slides:
 *
 * Slides are ordered to be before or after the current slide and do not rearrange
 * dynamically as the user scrolls. Only once the scrolling has ended do they rearrange.
 * Currently, half the slides are ordered before and half the slides are ordered after.
 * This could be a bit smarter and only place as many as are necessary on either side of
 * the reference point to have a sufficient amount of buffer.
 *
 * Initial index:
 *
 * The initial index can be specified, which will make the carousel scroll to
 * the desired index when it first renders.
 *
 * @param {!BaseCarouselDef.SlideProps} props
 * @return {PreactDef.Renderable}
